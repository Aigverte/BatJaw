Data files of the bat jaw project

The files in this directory were used to simulate the mathematical model described in the file "Simulations_SI.pdf" and to produce the enclosed Figures in that document. 

The .mph files were all used to simulate the partial differential equations using COMSOL Multiphysics v5.5. They are organized by the dimension of the model simulated, with the 2D model comprising the majority of simulations (and the 1D model only explored for benchmarking etc). The file "SteadyStates.mw" was used to check analytical calculations regarding Turing instabilities to understand pattern-forming parameter regimes. Finally, the .mat files were used to make 1D and 2D figures from exported csv files from COMSOL. The 3D Figure in the PDF document was created within COMSOL itself as an exported image.

Please contact andrew.krause@durham.ac.uk if you have any trouble using or understanding these codes.
